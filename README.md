### Welcome to my Github account!  My name is Daniel and I will be your tour guide, first a little about me!  I am a 12 year veteran whom has served in both the Marine Corps Reserves and Air Force Reserves, in the USMCR I was a Combat Engineer for 6 years while in the Air Force Reserves I currently serve as an Air Transportation Journeyman in the Joint Inspection section.  We ensure various special cargo is air worthy before receiving it and we in check such special cargo, we are in control of this cargo before it departs our port.  I am 33 years old and I currently reside in Alabama; I love various anime, video games, and movies/televsion shows.  I am attending SNHU for my Bachelor's in Computer Science focused on Software Engineering with anticipated graduation date in March 2022. (so this should be updated again then)

I currently have two major projects I am working on outside of school:
1) A Python GUI project focused on being a resource for Final Fantasy 14 users to be able to view arms, armor, and even items for various classes with the images of such items being derived directly from the site while the information is independently typed in by myself.  Once finished putting everything in I expect to make a few changes to it before launching it, mostly cosmetic.  My goal for this project was something I could use while playing the game and it could be open on a second window without needing to have to tab out of the game and open a browser; I am using Atlassian's Jira to track my progress in the project.

2) This is a mobile project that I am building for the Air Force career field I am in, that much I can say; I am currently waiting to push this into the Air Force's GAINS program; this project is set to private currently.  Will update this once that is done.

Thank you for dropping by!
